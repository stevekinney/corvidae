// Type-level tripwire (COR-2130): a plugin that returns a contribution key by its old name fails
// type-checking, so a rename cannot be silently undone and a plugin written against the old
// contract is told at compile time. `PluginContributions` has no index signature, so an unknown key
// is an excess-property error.

import type { PluginContributions, PluginTrigger } from './index.ts';

declare const trigger: PluginTrigger;

// The new key is accepted.
export const renamed: PluginContributions = { triggers: [trigger] };

// @ts-expect-error -- `triggerKinds` was renamed `triggers`
export const staleTriggerKinds: PluginContributions = { triggerKinds: [trigger] };
