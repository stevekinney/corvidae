 * for the state that says so (no engine has a scheduled flush left) instead of yielding one
 * event-loop turn and hoping the flush landed within it, then drains microtasks, which is all
 * that remains for a workflow on in-memory storage. A start queued by a turn that just ran
 * (`ctx.startChild`) is waited for the same way.
