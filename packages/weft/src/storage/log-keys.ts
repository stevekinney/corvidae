 * `log:<runId>:<seq>` holds one line (`seq` zero-padded to 16 digits, so a scan is in write
 * order). `log-counter:<runId>` holds the run's counter record: the next sequence number, the
 * sequence of the oldest retained line, how many lines the cap evicted (`dropped`), and when the
 * run last wrote a line. The counter lives under its own prefix so a scan of a run's lines never
 * meets it and a retention pass can list the runs that hold lines without reading any line.
 *
 * Both families belong to the run: a purge removes them with it. Terminal cleanup does not, so a
 * finished run keeps its lines until the retention window passes.
