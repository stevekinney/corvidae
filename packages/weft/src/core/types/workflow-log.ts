/**
 * The structured logger exposed as `WorkflowContext.log`. Each method emits
 * a {@link WorkflowLogRecord} to the current process console (`console.debug` /
 * `console.info` / `console.warn` / `console.error`) with `workflowId`,
 * `workflowType`, `level`, and `timestamp` auto-attached. Caller-supplied
 * `attributes` are nested under their own key and cannot overwrite the envelope.
 *
 * Replay behavior: a workflow body re-executes from the start on recovery, or
 * when a parked run (a signal, a review, a timer) continues, to rebuild state.
 * Log calls in the already-committed replay window are suppressed, so a
 * continued run does not re-emit logs it already emitted: a log call sitting at
 * a step the engine has already cached is silenced. The operation the run was
 * parked on is not cached, so the log calls in front of it are delivered again
 * (`ctx.log('before wait'); yield* ctx.waitForSignal('go')` reaches the sink on
 * the first run and again on resume), marked {@link WorkflowLogRecord.replayed}.
 * The persisted log store skips a marked record, so a line is stored once; a
 * host `onLog` sink that wants one entry per call does the same. A log call past
 * the parked operation is new work and carries no mark. This holds in both inline
 * and worker execution modes.
 *
 * One replay caveat. A log call that runs after an operation completed and before
 * the next operation yields is logged again, unmarked, if the run crashes in that
 * window (the checkpoint that would record the operation's result is written at
 * the next yield, so recovery re-enters that operation and runs the log call
 * again). Logs inside `ctx.all` / `ctx.runAll` branches follow that branch's
 * re-execution semantics.
 *
 * A host sink installed via `EngineOptions.onLog` receives records from BOTH execution
 * modes: inline records directly, and worker-mode records forwarded from the worker
 * back to the host. When no sink is installed, worker-mode records go to the worker
 * process console (and inline records to the engine-host console). Inline log
 * timestamps come from the engine clock; worker-mode timestamps come from the worker
 * process wall clock.
 *
 * Exported so a host can also type a logger it injects through `ctx.services`
 * (the pre-`ctx.log` pattern).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { workflow, type WorkflowContext, type WorkflowLogger } from '@lostgradient/weft';
 *
 * const myWorkflow = workflow({ name: 'my-workflow' }).execute(async function* (
 *   ctx: WorkflowContext,
 * ) {
 *   ctx.log?.info('workflow started', { attempt: 1 });
 *   ctx.log?.warn('retrying activity', { reason: 'timeout' });
 *   // A host logger injected through `ctx.services` can reuse this type:
 *   const { log } = (ctx.services ?? {}) as { log?: WorkflowLogger };
 *   log?.error('activity failed', { error: 'ECONNREFUSED' });
 * });
 * void myWorkflow;
 * ```
