/**
 * `createWorkflowFactory`: one shared set of activities, signals, updates, and
 * queries that every workflow built from the factory declares.
 *
 * The factory registers nothing by itself. Each builder it returns starts with
 * the shared entries already declared, so `.execute(fn)` freezes them into the
 * workflow definition exactly as if the workflow had called `.uses({...})`,
 * `.signals({...})`, `.updates({...})`, and `.queries({...})`. Shared
 * activities are engine-provided: dispatch resolves them through the engine's
 * activity registry, so they must be registered on the engine. The factory's
 * `createEngine` does that and the workflow registration in one call.
 *
 * This module sits outside `core/types/` because `createEngine` constructs an
 * `Engine`, and the engine imports the types barrel.

 * The value {@link createWorkflowFactory} returns. Its members are plain

 * - `workflow` takes the options `workflow({ name })` takes and returns a

 * - `activities` is the shared activity definitions, frozen.
 * - `createEngine` creates an engine with the given workflows and the shared
 *   activities registered. It first checks that every activity any workflow
 *   declares with `.uses()` is provided, and throws `ActivityResolutionError`
 *   before creating the engine if one is not, so no workflow starts or
 *   recovers against an engine missing an activity.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createWorkflowFactory, type WorkflowFactory } from '@lostgradient/weft';
 *
 * // A factory with no shared entries builds the same workflows `workflow()` does.
 * const factory: WorkflowFactory = createWorkflowFactory({});

 * `ctx.run('name', input)`, `ctx.waitForSignal('name')`, and the rest for the
 * shared entries.
 *
 * Shared activities are declared on each workflow as if by `.uses({...})`:
 * they are engine-provided, so the engine must register them. Create the
 * engine with the returned `createEngine`, which registers the shared
 * activities with the workflows and refuses to create an engine that would be
 * missing one.
 *
 * A workflow can still add its own entries with `.activities({...})`,
 * `.uses({...})`, `.signals({...})`, `.updates({...})`, and `.queries({...})`;
 * they merge with the shared ones. Redeclaring a name the factory already
 * declares, in any of them, is a type error and throws `WorkflowBuilderError`,
 * so a shared name means the same thing in every workflow. Declared signals,
 * updates, and queries are closed sets, so the factory's declarations close
 * them for every workflow it builds: a message whose name no declaration lists
 * is rejected.

 * ```ts
 * import { activity, createWorkflowFactory, signal } from '@lostgradient/weft';
