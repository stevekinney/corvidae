/**
 * The driver of one branch of an advancing parallel step: the branch's generator, run in a step

 *
 * A `ctx.all` branch is a single operation. A branch of an advancing parallel step is a sequence of
 * them that the engine resumes as each settles, so one branch moves on while its siblings are still
 * on an earlier step. Resuming a generator is synchronous, so the driver swaps the context's step
 * counter and result cache for the branch's own around each call and restores them after: the
 * branch counts its steps from zero and keeps its own results, whatever order its siblings settle
 * in, and a replay that feeds the same results back numbers every step the same way.
