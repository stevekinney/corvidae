/**
 * COR-1925: a tick commits its run, the schedule that names it and the next timer in one batch, and
 * resolves the run's services only once that batch has committed. A process that dies between the
 * commit and the resolver leaves a run recovery can finish: it asks the resolver for the run's
 * services with the schedule and occurrence the run belongs to, and the timer that fired does not
 * start the occurrence a second time.
