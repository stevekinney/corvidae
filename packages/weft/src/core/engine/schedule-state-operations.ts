 *
 * The serialization is per engine process, so the write is also conditioned on the exact bytes it
 * was decided from (COR-1594): `apply` is handed the conditions and puts them in its write's
 * `extraConditions`. A write that loses them read a schedule another process has since changed.
 * The state is then read again and the transition decided again, so the `expectedRevision`
 * comparison runs against what is stored now: an unchanged revision retries (the other change
 * did not touch what the caller named), and a different one is stale. A call with no
 * `expectedRevision` applies to whatever is stored now.
