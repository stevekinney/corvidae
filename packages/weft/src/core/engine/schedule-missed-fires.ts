/**
 * What a schedule records when it misses occurrences (COR-1829): the counters on the schedule, the
 * persisted row of each miss, and the read of those rows.
 *
 * A row is keyed by schedule, occurrence and reason ({@link KEYS.scheduleMissed}) and is written in
 * the same storage batch as the schedule state that counts it, so a miss is either counted and
 * recorded or neither. A backfilled tick writes what it missed with its first run, before the
 * schedule's `nextFireAt` moves, so a crash before its last write replays the same misses. The
 * schedule's `lastMissedFireAt` is the watermark that tells a replayed miss from a new one: misses
 * only ever come from instants after the previous tick's anchor, so one at or before the watermark
 * was recorded already, and is neither counted nor written again.
