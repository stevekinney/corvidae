/**
 * `recoverAll()` snapshots every stored run in its preflight, then resumes the recoverable ones in
 * turn. Under `ownership: 'workflow-lease'` the engine's own claim-reclaim drive can take over a
 * lapsed claim in the batch and complete that run between the preflight and the batch's resume of
 * it. The resume then throws "status is completed", which nothing isolated, so the whole batch
 * rejected and no later entry's handle came back (COR-1593).
 *
 * A run that became terminal after the preflight because another drive owned it counts as
 * recovered elsewhere: the batch returns no handle for it, records no failure, and goes on.
 *
 * The batch is held with an earlier entry's `onRecoveredWorkflow` hook, which runs after that
 * entry's claim is acquired and before its generator starts, so the reclaim pass leaves that entry
 * alone and drives only the lapsed one. No wall clock: the claims lapse by the engines' own clocks.
