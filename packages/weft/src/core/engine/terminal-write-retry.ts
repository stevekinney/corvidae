 *
 * - The record holds this batch's own bytes: the earlier attempt landed and only its
 *   acknowledgement was lost. The write is done and nothing is sent again.
 * - The record is what the write was decided from: send the same batch under the first attempt's
 *   conditions plus a compare-and-swap on the bytes just read, so a change made after the read
 *   loses instead of being overwritten (a storage without `conditionalBatch` cannot guard it).
 * - The record is another writer's change to the same run while it is still not terminal, and the
 *   caller gave a `rebuild`: build the batch again over that fresher record, keeping the other
 *   writer's change, and send it under a compare-and-swap on the fresh bytes. Without a `rebuild`
 *   the failure write's own re-decision (`settleLostDecision`) does this.
 * - Anything else (the record is terminal and not this write's, another run's, gone, or unreadable)
 *   is not a record this write can end: nothing is sent, and `onLostRace()` is thrown for the caller
 *   to settle from what is stored.
 *
 * A send that loses its compare-and-swap reads the record once more: a write that landed between
 * the read and the send is done; otherwise another writer changed it first, and the next attempt
 * decides again. Every attempt, send or not, counts against the retry budget, and a budget spent
 * raises `CheckpointCommitFailedError`.
