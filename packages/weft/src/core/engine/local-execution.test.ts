/**
 * A start's record is the only state the engine keeps for it while it is queued or launching, and
 * every transition takes the record its start made and acts only while that record is still the
 * id's current one (COR-1625). A launch that awaited while a `start-new` replacement recorded its
 * own record under the same id must leave that record alone, whether it hands over, settles its
 * flush, moves its flush to launching, or lets go; otherwise a reclaim replays the replacement while
 * it is still launching, or `engine.get()` misreports it.
