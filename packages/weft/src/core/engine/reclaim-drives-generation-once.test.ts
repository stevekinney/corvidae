/**
 * A claim takeover and `recoverAll()` both drive a workflow this engine has just come to hold.
 * The reclaim pass takes the dead owner's claim and then pauses (reloading pending async
 * activities) before it replays the workflow from storage; a `recoverAll()` that runs in that
 * pause resumes the same generation under the claim the reclaim already installed. The reclaim's
 * forced replay skips the local-ownership check `recoverAll()` makes, so unless it notices the
 * drive it would start a second one, and the activity would run twice (COR-1618).
 *
 * The reclaim is held at `reclaimReplayGateForTesting`, the one seam added for this, and the
 * store-backed counter counts how many times the activity ran. Each case must end with it at one.
