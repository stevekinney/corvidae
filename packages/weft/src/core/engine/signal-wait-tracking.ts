/**
 * The durable `WorkflowState.waitingForSignals` list (COR-1472): which signals a
 * running workflow is parked on, written into its `wf:` record so `engine.get()`
 * reports it across a restart.
 *
 * Every change is a read-modify-write of the `wf:` record inside
 * {@link runSerializedWorkflowStateWrite}, the per-workflow chain that this
 * engine's terminal, suspend, and tag writes also run in, so a change applies
 * in the order it was requested and never interleaves with them. The commit is
 * also conditioned on the record bytes it was computed from, so a write by
 * another engine between the read and the commit (a cancel, say) makes this one
 * decide again rather than write `running` back over it.
 *
 * A change applies only while the record is the run the wait started under
 * (see {@link SignalWaitRun}), still `running`, and not being terminalized, and
 * while this engine is not shutting down: a wait torn down by `dispose()` is
 * still outstanding durably, which is the whole point of persisting it. Leaving
 * `running` removes the list in the terminal or suspend write itself
 * (`withoutSignalWaits` in `signal-wait-state.ts`).
 *
 * Neither function here rejects (see `changeSignalWaits`), so a caller may
 * await one for ordering without guarding a failure.
