/**
 * A resume from storage that has not yet adopted its workflow's checkpoint leaves no local mark on
 * the engine: no checkpoint, no inline execution. A second resume of the same run in that window
 * (here, a second `recoverAll()` while the first is held in `resolveWorkflowServices`, as a
 * Bureau's reclaim is held while the Bureau finishes composing) used to drive the run alongside the
 * first, so the later checkpoint commit lost its compare-and-swap and the run was abandoned with
 * `WorkflowCheckpointConflictError`. The second resume must join the first.
