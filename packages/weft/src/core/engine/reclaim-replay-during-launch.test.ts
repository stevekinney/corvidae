/**
 * A reclaim's replay that arrives while a resume of the same generation is in the middle of its
 * launch must join that resume, not start a second one (COR-1618). A resume that has adopted the
 * checkpoint is no longer joinable, and it is not yet a launched drive, so nothing a replay can
 * see in that interval would stop it: the resume therefore awaits nothing between adopting the
 * checkpoint and starting the generator, and does the one storage scan it needs before adopting.
 *
 * Drive A is `recoverAll()`'s resume, held in the scan of the run's child-cancellation records,
 * the only storage read of a resume that is not before its adoption's turn. The reclaim's replay
 * is released while A is held.
