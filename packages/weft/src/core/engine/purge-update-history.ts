 * Remove a run's update history (`uph:`), and the answered responses (`upr:`) it names, in batches of

 *
 * The history has no bound: a long-lived entity workflow can receive thousands of updates. Folded into
 * the purge batch, each entry would add two operations to a batch that holds at most 10,000, so a
 * large enough history would make the run impossible to purge, and the history is removed by purge
 * alone (terminal cleanup keeps it by design).
 *
 * It is safe to stop partway and to run again. Each chunk is one atomic batch that removes an entry
 * together with the response it names, so what remains always names the responses still to remove.
 * A purge that fails partway leaves the run in place with a shorter history, and the next purge
 * finishes the job; a response left behind could only be one the five-minute sweep removes anyway.
 *
 * Each chunk is fenced on the run record the purge observed, where the storage can fence: a
 * same-id `start-new` replacement changes those bytes, and a chunk that lost to it removes nothing, so
 * the replacement's own history (it shares the key prefix) is never touched. A lost fence ends the
 * drain quietly; the purge's own commit, fenced the same way, reports the loss.
