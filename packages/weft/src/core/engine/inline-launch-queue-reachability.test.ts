/**
 * COR-1425: an engine whose scheduled flush has not run must stay reachable.
 *
 * A queued inline start runs only when the engine's flush message is delivered, and the handler
 * for that message reaches its engine through a `WeakRef`. A caller that keeps only the promise
 * from `handle.result()`, or a continuation suspended on it, holds nothing a garbage collector
 * treats as a root: that continuation, the handle, the result waiter, the engine, and the engine's
 * internals reference only one another. So a collection between the end of the microtask turn
 * that queued the start and the delivery of the flush reclaimed the engine, the handler found
 * nothing to run, and `result()` never settled. Weft's bulk-signal test hung this way whenever
 * JavaScriptCore collected at that boundary, which Bun's event loop does when a collection timer
 * is pending as it takes newly posted tasks.
 *
 * The first test forces that ordering instead of waiting for load to produce it: it holds each
 * engine's flush message as it is delivered, runs a full collection, and only then lets the flush
 * run. The second proves the engine is held only for that window.
