/**
 * The deployment build a start binds its run to (COR-1582). A start's create batch requires the

 * the build, so a run is never committed against a removed build and a removal that read the stamp
 * earlier cannot commit past it. Every caller of `buildAndCommitStartBatch` gets both from the
 * state it commits: the build is the one in `state.workerBinding.current`, which covers a fresh
 * start, a restart, a child, a scheduled occurrence, and `prepare()`.
