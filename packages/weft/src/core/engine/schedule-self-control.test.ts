/**
 * COR-1482: a scheduled run that calls `pauseSchedule`, `cancelSchedule`, or `updateSchedule` on
 * its own schedule must not wedge it. On the backfill path the timer callback waits for the run's
 * turn to finish, and pause, resume, cancel, and update take the schedule's serialization, so the
 * timer callback must not hold that serialization while it waits.
 *
 * A hang fails these tests through the runner's own per-test timeout.
