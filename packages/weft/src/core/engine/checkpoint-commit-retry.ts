 * Retry a checkpoint batch whose first attempt storage refused with `firstError`, and report
 * whether it committed. The batch is the same one, with the same operations and conditions: it
 * already holds the commit's staged side effects (they left the engine when the batch was built),
 * so recomputing it would drop them.
 *
 * An attempt that commits, or that loses its compare-and-swap while `wf:<id>:ckpt` already holds
 * this batch's own bytes, counts as committed: the earlier attempt landed and only its
 * acknowledgement was lost, so the caller finishes the commit's bookkeeping instead of reporting
 * a conflict with itself. A loss against any other bytes returns `false`, a genuine loss.
