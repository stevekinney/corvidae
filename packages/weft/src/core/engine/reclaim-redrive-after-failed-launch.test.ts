/**
 * A launch that adopted a workflow's checkpoint and then failed before its generator or worker
 * started is not a live drive (COR-1618). The reclaim skips a replay when a drive already began
 * under the claim it took, so the skip must not fire for a launch that never got going: the
 * reclaim target records the failed drive for redrive at the claim's epoch, and the next pass has
 * to drive the run, not report it reclaimed with nothing running under a claim it keeps renewing.
 *
 * The launch is failed once with a transient storage error on the scan of the run's child
 * cancellation records, the first read after adoption (`rehydrateChildCancellationHandlers`).
