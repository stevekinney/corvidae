/**
 * COR-1604: a memo helper activity's retry sleep is woken by its durable timer.
 *
 * The retry sleep scheduled its timer without the run's execution token but bound
 * its resolver to that token, so the timer could never match the resolver: the
 * fire was collected as another generation's, and a retry with a real backoff
 * never ran. Time is driven by hand through the scheduler, never by sleeping.
