/**
 * An inline start's launch is queued, and its generator exists only once the queue flushes. A
 * reclaim can meet the run in that state: a listing takes its exclude set before the start folds
 * its claim and then lists the start's own holder record, so the pass redrives a run this engine
 * is about to drive itself. The reclaim leaves the run to the queued launch and returns (COR-1618).
 * It must not wait for the flush: under `inlineLaunchScheduling: 'manual'` only the host flushes,
 * and a host that awaits the pass before it flushes would wait forever, along with the renewal of
 * every other claim the pass carries.
 *
 * A queued launch that throws before its generator exists drives nothing, and nothing else would:
 * the engine holds the run's checkpoint and renews its claim, which hides the run from
 * `recoverAll()` and from the reclaim scan alike. So the flush reports the failure and lets the
 * run go, in memory and durably, and the next reclaim pass acquires and drives it as an ownerless
 * running workflow.
 *
 * A start enqueued under a claim the engine has since lost and taken back carries the checkpoint
 * of its enqueue, which another holder may have advanced. The reclaim that took the claim back
 * does not defer to that start; it drives the run from storage, and the flush discards the start.
