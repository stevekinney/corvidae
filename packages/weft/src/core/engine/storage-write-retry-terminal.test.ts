/**
 * COR-1626, review round 1: what a retried terminal or checkpoint write sends, reads and settles.
 *
 * A terminal write is never sent again once the record holds its own bytes, and never over another
 * writer's change; a completion that landed settles its waiter from the stored outcome even when
 * every retry is refused; the retry carries the conditions of the first attempt; it runs under
 * `ownership: 'lease'`; disposal during an attempt starts no further attempt; and the error's message
 * never carries the storage adapter's text.
