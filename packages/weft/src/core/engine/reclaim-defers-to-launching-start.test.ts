/**
 * A delayed start's fire, and a prepared start's launch, hold the claim they folded or committed
 * under across the awaits between their `running` commit and their launch: a re-provision of the
 * run's services, the terminal-cleanup marker read, the start headers. In that window the run is
 * neither queued nor live, so a reclaim pass whose listing predates the fold redrove it: it found
 * nothing to defer to and nothing live, replayed from storage, and the fire then adopted over that
 * replay and enqueued under the same epoch, so two generators drove one generation (COR-1625).
 *
 * The launch now records a launching marker in the turn its commit lands, which a reclaim defers
 * to exactly as it defers to a queued inline start. `engine.get()` keeps reporting `running`. A
 * launch that stops short of its generator lets the run go, claim included, so the next reclaim
 * pass lists the run ownerless and drives it once.
 *
 * Scheduling is `'manual'`, so a queued launch stays queued until the test flushes it, and the
 * reclaim pass is driven by hand, so the listing can be held across the fire's commit.
