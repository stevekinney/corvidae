/**
 * Thrown when storage refused one of a workflow's engine-owned writes on every attempt the engine
 * makes in process: the checkpoint batch (`wf:<id>:ckpt` and the `ev:<id>:*` event-log records
 * together), the terminal `wf:<id>` write of a completion, or the `wf:<id>` write of a failure.
 * The engine retries a refused write a bounded number of times (the first attempt and four
 * retries, 750 ms of waiting in all) before it raises this error, which carries the workflow, the
 * write, the attempt count, and the last storage error as `cause`.
 *
 * A refused checkpoint or completion write then fails the workflow as a `system` failure with this
 * error, so `handle.result()` rejects with it. A refused failure write leaves nothing durable to
 * write, so the engine stops driving the generation locally and rejects the pending `result()`
 * with it; the durable record stays `running` and the next boot recovers it from its last
 * committed checkpoint.
 *
 * The message is a fixed sentence naming the workflow, the write and the attempt count. The storage
 * adapter's own error, which can name tables, constraints or paths, is only on `cause`, so the
 * message can reach clients as a run's error.
 *
 * Like `CheckpointEncodingError` it is neither exported from the package root nor registered
 * in `WeftErrorCode`, so the public error vocabulary does not change.
