/**
 * COR-1626, correction 7: every exit that ends a run after one of its writes failed is bound to
 * the run that issued the write, and never touches another run that holds the same workflow id.
 *
 * The matrix crosses the exits (rows) with the state of the workflow id when the exit decides
 * (columns). The column's change lands in the narrowest window an exit has: its own read of the
 * record, after the write's last attempt and before its decision. The read answers with the bytes
 * from before the change, so the exit sees the run still open, which is the race as it happens.
 * Every cell asserts the stored record and whose it is, `result()` for the issuing run and for a
 * replacement, the failed events announced, and what is held for the id afterwards: the execution
 * attempt, the concurrency slot's holder marker, and the result waiter. Ownership claims exist only
 * under `workflow-lease`, which the claim tests in `terminal-write-outcomes.test.ts` cover.
 *
 * The second half turns the two probes of review thread 4351725341 into regressions: a same-id
 * `start-new` replacement installed while the checkpoint batch is still being retried.
