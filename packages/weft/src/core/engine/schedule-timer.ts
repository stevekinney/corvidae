/**
 * Whether the stored schedule still owes the occurrence `entry` fired, so that deleting the entry
 * would leave an active schedule that no timer wakes until some engine boots (COR-1925,
 * COR-1985). That is the case whenever the stored schedule is active and its next occurrence is
 * still the entry's, whatever the tick did. Two ways to get there:
 *
 * - A catch-up. A backfill commits each occurrence it starts (`lastFireAt`) and moves
 *   `nextFireAt`, and so replaces the entry, only with the last. A tick that stands aside because
 *   another engine went on with the catch-up (its start or write lost) leaves the fired entry as
 *   the schedule's only timer; if that engine dies before its last write, deleting the entry
 *   would strand the schedule. A delivery that finds the remaining occurrences already started by
 *   the other engine starts none of them again: it resumes after `lastFireAt`, and its starts are
 *   conditioned on the schedule it read.
 * - A write that re-armed the same occurrence. An update that keeps the interval keeps the anchor
 *   and `nextFireAt`, and so puts the timer again under the key (`schedule-due:<at>:<id>`) the
 *   tick that stood aside from it is about to delete. The key names the occurrence, not the
 *   generation of the timer, so the tick cannot tell the entry it fired from the one the write
 *   put; only the stored schedule can.
 *
 * So the entry is kept, and delivered again, until the stored schedule shows its occurrence
 * handled (`nextFireAt` moved, and the last write armed the next timer) or no longer active. A
 * tick that handled the occurrence itself has moved `nextFireAt`, so a normal tick keeps nothing.

 * unchanged.
 *
 * The pause is made in a serialized section, from the schedule as it is now, and only if it is

 * the wait owns the schedule, and a pause written on top of it, or from the state this tick last
