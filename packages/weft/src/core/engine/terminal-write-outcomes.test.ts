/**
 * COR-1626, review round 2: every exit from the terminal-write path ends the run's waiter.
 *
 * The invariant is stated once and held by a matrix: eight behaviours of the storage and of another
 * writer, each crossed with the two terminal writes (a completion and a failure). Every cell asserts
 * the same five things:
 *
 * - the in-flight `result()` settles;
 * - a `result()` requested afterwards on a fresh handle settles;
 * - the durable record is terminal, except in the one ruled abandon case: a failure write refused
 *   on every attempt, which leaves the record `running` for the next boot;
 * - no change another writer made is overwritten;
 * - nothing the engine held for the run is left behind (the result waiter, the checkpoint), and
 *   the leak guard that runs after every test sees no timer left armed.
 *
 * A hang in any cell fails it by the test runner's own timeout.
