/**

 * terminal state. Every function here reads or clears `state.currentWorkflowId`
 * and its `KEYS.scheduleRun(workflowId)` record.
 *
 * `schedules.ts` owns the schedule API itself (create, list, pause, resume,
 * cancel, update) and names these only as `ScheduleCallbacks` fields, which
 * `callback-creators-schedule.ts` wires up — so nothing here is called from
 * there and the only edge back is a type import.
