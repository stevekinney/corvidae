/**
 * What a reclaim's forced replay checks just before it restarts a workflow (COR-1618), forced
 * through the reclaim gate and a storage read a test holds:
 *
 * - the claim epoch is read again after the gate, so a claim lost and taken back during the
 *   reclaim's awaits is checked against the claim held now;
 * - the check shares its synchronous turn with the replay's join-or-register decision, so a drive
 *   that began while the replay was reading the workflow's state is not driven a second time;
 * - the check names the generation it is replaying, so a drive of another generation under the same
 *   claim does not stop the replay.
