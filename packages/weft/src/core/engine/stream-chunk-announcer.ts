 * not cost one watch-storage write and one fleet-feed append per chunk.
 *
 * A key's first chunk after a quiet period is announced at once and opens a
 * window. Chunks inside the window only record their sequence: when it closes,
 * the announcer announces the latest stored sequence if it is newer than the
 * one announced, which opens the next window, and otherwise forgets the key.
 * {@link settle} announces a pending sequence at once when a stream finishes,
 * so the last chunk of every stream is announced before the stream operation
 * returns, and {@link discard} drops it unannounced when a failed stream's
 * partial chunks are removed.
 *
 * Every event is tagged with the execution token of the run that stored the
 * chunk it names, so `Engine.dispatchEvent` drops one from a run a `start-new`
 * replacement superseded, a trailing event included.
