/**
 * Holding a terminated run's result back until its in-flight top-level activity has settled
 * (COR-1597).
 *
 * A cancel, a timeout, or the history circuit breaker commits the terminal state at once, but the
 * run's inline `activity` is still running and writing. The result waiter is settled only after
 * the handler turn that runs the activity ends, so anything a reader does after `result()` sees
 * what the activity wrote. Everything else about the termination, the committed state, the
 * terminal lifecycle event and the event forwarded to the handle, happens when it did.
 *
 * The settlement is a detached continuation on the captured turn, never an await on the
 * termination path: the history breaker terminates from inside the very turn it waits for, and
 * `engine.cancel()` and `engine.timeout()` return as soon as the terminal state is committed.
 *
 * A pending settlement is visible to every other path that would settle the waiter from the
 * durable terminal state, so one place holds back the first `result()` call after the commit, the
 * automatic poll, and the manual `runMaintenance()` poll alike. Nothing here builds on the claim
 * epoch, which `terminateWorkflow` has already released.
 *
 * Nothing waits on code that never settles. A cancel or a timeout aborts the activity's signal, a
 * configured `timeout` bounds an activity that ignores it, and disposal releases every pending
 * settlement with the terminal error that is already committed, not with `EngineDisposedError`.
 *
