/**
 * What this engine holds in memory for a workflow's execution, read from the things that own it.
 *
 * An inline start is queued and launched by `inline-launch-queue.ts`, which records its progress
 * here as one record per start ({@link PendingLaunch}), the only state kept for a queued or
 * launching start; what used to be two membership indexes on `EngineInternals` is derived from the
 * record's existence and phase. A reclaim that meets a run whose launch is
 * queued or in flight under the claim it holds neither counts it as driven nor drives it a second
 * time, nor waits for it: it leaves the run to the flush (`defersToQueuedInlineWorkflowStart`).
 *
 * A run is *live* when the strategy that executes it holds it: for the inline strategy a context,
 * a turn still being handled, or the parked marker of a run waiting for a signal; for a worker
 * strategy, whose worker is acquired asynchronously, the in-memory checkpoint the engine holds for
 * the run from adoption until terminal cleanup, suspension, or disposal releases it. These are the
 * same terms `recoverAll()`'s preflight reads as local ownership (`isInlineWorkflowLocallyOwned`,
 * `hasLocalCheckpointOwnership`), without the queued launch, which is deferred to rather than live.
 *
 * This module imports nothing but the internals type, so the resume path can read it without a
 * cycle through the lifecycle barrel.
