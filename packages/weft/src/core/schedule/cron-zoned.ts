/**
 * Cron occurrences in a time zone with daylight-saving transitions.
 *
 * A cron expression names wall-clock times, so a zone's calendar is searched, not its instants:
 * the next local date-time the expression matches is found on a calendar that has no
 * transitions (the local time read as UTC), then resolved to the instant it names. That makes
 * both transitions fall out of one rule, "a wall-clock time happens once":
 *
 * - A local time that does not exist (the hour skipped when the clock springs forward) cannot
 *   resolve to an instant. It is reported as a tick at the transition, the first instant after
 *   the gap, that does not fire and counts the matches it skipped.
 * - A local time that happens twice (the hour repeated when the clock falls back) resolves to its
 *   first instant, and the second pass is not offered again.
 *
 * A consequence of the second rule: an expression that matches every minute or every hour fires
 * through the repeated hour only once. A schedule that must run on elapsed time uses an interval.
