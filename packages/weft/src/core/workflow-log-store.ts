/**
 * The persisted `ctx.log` lines of a workflow run (COR-1811): a bounded, buffered sink that writes
 * the lines the engine emits, a reader that serves them per run and per step, and a retention pass
 * that drops the lines of finished runs that went quiet.
 *
 * The sink is the host's `EngineOptions.onLog`; the engine is handed the same store through
 * `EngineOptions.workflowLogs`, which is how `Engine.getLogs` reads (after flushing the buffered
 * tail), how a shutdown flushes, and how a purge removes a run's lines with the run.
 *
 * Bounds, all documented on {@link WorkflowLogStoreOptions}: a run keeps at most
 * `maximumLinesPerRun` lines (500 by default), evicting the oldest and counting each in
 * {@link WorkflowLogsResult.dropped}; a line's message and attributes together are held to
 * `maximumLineBytes` (2 KiB by default): a long message is cut with a visible marker, and
 * attributes that do not fit beside it are dropped.
 *
 * Durability: the sink is asynchronous. A line is buffered in memory and written in a batch on the
 * next turn, on {@link WorkflowLogStore.flush}, and on engine shutdown (`shutdown()` or `await using`;
 * a synchronous `using` disposal cannot await storage, so it flushes nothing). A crash can lose the lines
 * of the turn that had not been written yet; that is accepted. A write that fails drops its batch
 * and reports to {@link WorkflowLogStoreOptions.onError}; a log must never fail the run it describes.
 *
 * The store assumes one writer per run, which Weft's one-engine-per-store rule already guarantees:
 * each write reads the run's counter record, extends it, and writes it back with the lines.
 *
