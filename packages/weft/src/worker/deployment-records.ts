/**
 * Keys and decoders of the stored deployment records. Names and ids are URI-encoded in every key,
 * so a name containing the `:` separator cannot collide with a neighbour.
 *
 * - **Version**, at `worker-deployment-version:<deployment>:<build>`: the MessagePack encoding of a
 *   `WorkerDeploymentVersion`. Its `state` is `ready`, `draining` or `removed`.
 * - **Routing pointer**, at `worker-deployment-routing:<deployment>`: the MessagePack encoding of a
 *   `WorkerDeploymentRouting`.
 * - **Binding stamp**, 64 shards per build, at
 *   `worker-deployment-binding:<deployment>:<build>:<k>`, where `<k>` is two lowercase hex digits,
 *   `00` to `3f`. A shard holds sixteen random bytes. Every commit that binds durable work to the
 *   build (a run's worker binding, or a task-ledger entry whose requirement names the build) writes
 *   a fresh value to exactly one shard, blind, in the same batch as that work. The shard is the
 *   32-bit FNV-1a hash of the binding's own key (the run id, or the ledger entry's operation id),
 *   taken over its UTF-8 bytes, modulo 64: concurrent bindings land on different shards, so on a
 *   backend that serializes writes to one row (Postgres and Neon run each conditional batch at
 *   `SERIALIZABLE`) they do not abort one another the way one shared row would. An absent shard
 *   means no binding has used it. Only `remove` reads the shards: all 64, before it scans, and it
 *   conditions its write on every one, so any binding that commits after the scan began changes a
 *   shard in the removal's read set and makes it rescan. Shards are compared and never decoded.
 *   **64 is persisted format.** It cannot change without reading the old shards too.
 *   The hash that picks a binding's shard is not format: `remove` conditions on every shard, so a
 *   binding on any shard is caught, and the choice of shard can change without reading old data.
 * - **Removal tombstone**, at `worker-deployment-removed:<deployment>:<build>`: one opaque byte,
 *   written once, in the same batch as the version record's `removed` state, and never deleted.
 *   Every commit that binds durable work to the build requires it to be absent, so a binding that
 *   meets a removed build fails and binds nothing. It is checked for presence and never decoded.
 *
 * Together they make removal optimistic concurrency, not a lock: nothing is held, so nothing can be
 * left behind by a crash, and there is nothing to reconcile.
