/**
 * Removing a deployment build by optimistic concurrency (COR-1582).
 *
 * `remove` reads the build's version (which must be `draining`), the routing pointer, and the
 * build's 64 binding stamp shards, in that order and before it scans; scans the run records and the
 * non-terminal task-ledger entries for work bound to the build; and, if there is none, writes
 * `removed` and the build's tombstone in one batch conditioned on the exact bytes of the version,
 * the routing pointer and every stamp shard it read (an absent shard is conditioned as absent). Every
 * commit that binds work to a build puts a fresh stamp and requires the tombstone absent
 * (`deployment-records.ts`), so any binding that commits after the stamp was read changes it and
 * fails the removal's write, and any that commits after the removal meets the tombstone.
 *
 * A lost write reads everything again: a build that is now `removed` answers as removed, a build
 * no longer draining or now routed answers that, and anything else rescans. Three attempts in all;
 * after the third the answer is `busy`, a retryable outcome. Nothing is held between the steps, so
 * a crash at any point leaves nothing behind to reconcile.
