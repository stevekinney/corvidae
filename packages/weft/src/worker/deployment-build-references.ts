/**
 * The durable work that is bound to a deployment build, computed on demand.
 *
 * Nothing keeps a counter. A reference is derived from the records themselves in one bounded
 * scan each of the run records (`wf:`) and the task ledger (`task-ledger:`), at the moment a build
 * is read or removed, so the answer cannot drift from the work it describes. This follows the
 * precedent of a workflow revision's removal (`core/engine/nonterminal-revision-count.ts`).
 *
 * What counts as a reference to a build:
 *
 * - a run that is not terminal (`running`, `pending`, or `suspended`) whose current worker binding
 *   names the build. That includes an auto-upgrade run, which still executes on its current build;
 * - a task-ledger entry that is not terminal (`queued`, `leased`, `completing`, `cancelling`, or
 *   `deadLettered`) whose execution requirement names the build. A requirement that carries a
 *   `buildId` and no `deploymentName` names that build in every deployment, so it counts for each.
 *
 * Schedules and revision realms do not pin a build, so they are not references.
 *
