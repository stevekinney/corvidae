/**
 * Driving and stopping A2A push delivery through a Weft outbox: `startPushDelivery`
 * drains the outbox on an interval, and `stopPushDeliveries` cancels every open
 * delivery to one push configuration and waits until each has settled, which is what
 * deleting a configuration needs before it returns.
 *
 * Push delivery accepts only an outbox whose adapter is `createHttpDeliveryAdapter`,
 * with a request timeout below the outbox's `attemptTimeoutMs`. The adapter then
 * aborts its own request before the outbox would stop waiting for it, so every
 * attempt settles and no push delivery ends with `cleanupPending: true`.
