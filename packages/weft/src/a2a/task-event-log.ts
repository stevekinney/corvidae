/**
 * The durable event log behind a workflow agent's A2A tasks.
 *
 * Every status and artifact change of a task is one `StreamResponse` appended to the
 * task's own log, in the same conditional batch that saves the task record, so the
 * record always names the sequence of the last event it reflects: its cursor. A
 * subscriber that reads the record and then follows the log from that cursor sees
 * every later change exactly once and never one the record already contains.
 *
 * Records share the task store's keys and format (`createWeftA2ATaskStore` reads
 * them), scoped by namespace, tenant, and owner. Each task also has one owner record,
 * keyed by its identifier alone, naming the scope it belongs to, so a change the
 * engine reports with only a workflow identifier can be applied to the right task.
 * The owner record outlives its task: pruning keeps it, because the engine's start
 * idempotency mapping is permanent, and the record is what keeps another caller who
 * reuses the same key from recreating the task in their own scope.
 *
 * Live delivery is in-process: a commit notifies the followers of the same log object.
 * A follower that falls behind reads the gap back from storage. When another process
 * can commit to the same storage (an engine under an ownership lease), a log created
 * with `recheck` also has each idle follower re-read the task record on that interval
 * and replay any events another process appended. Storage has no change feed, so this
 * is the same wait-for-local-commit-or-poll shape as Weft's durable fleet feed.
