/**
 * Keeps a workflow agent's A2A tasks in line with the workflows they serve.
 *
 * A task changes only by reconciliation: the runtime reads the workflow from
 * `engine.get`, projects it through `workflow-task-projection.ts`, and commits the
 * difference to the task's durable event log, then hands each appended event to the
 * push-notification sender. It reconciles a task whenever a request reads it, and
 * whenever the engine reports a lifecycle or signal event for its workflow, so a
 * streaming subscriber follows the workflow live and a task whose workflow changed
 * while no handler ran catches up on its next read.
 *
 * The persisted `waitingForSignals` still names a signal for a moment after the
 * signal is delivered, and a workflow that waits for the same name again lists it
 * once more. So after a delivery the runtime records the name it delivered and
 * treats it as consumed until the engine reports a new `signal:waiting` for that
 * name, or a reconciliation reads the workflow without the name listed. Every name
 * delivered is kept, so a workflow waiting on several signals at once, such as
 * `ctx.all` over two waits, has each answered wait hidden until the engine catches
 * up. The record is in memory: a restart forgets it, and the persisted list is then
 * read as it stands.
 *
 * Engine retention can purge a terminal workflow before the runtime has reconciled
 * its outcome, for example while no handler runs. A task whose workflow then reads
 * as `null` is settled as `FAILED`, with a status message saying the workflow record
 * is gone, since the engine keeps no trace of a purged run's outcome. That is safe to
 * conclude from a task record alone: the executor writes a task only after
 * `engine.get` has returned its workflow, so a workflow still being started has no
 * task record to settle, and its reads find no task.
