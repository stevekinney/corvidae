 * 401 (body and `WWW-Authenticate` challenge) for a rejected credential. A bad

 * and a fetch handler has no transport to supply it, so a request there is
 * never admitted by `mtls`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createOperationHandler, createOperationHandlerAuthenticator } from '@lostgradient/weft';
 *
 * const handler = createOperationHandler({
 *   operations: [],
 *   host: {},
 *   authenticate: createOperationHandlerAuthenticator(
