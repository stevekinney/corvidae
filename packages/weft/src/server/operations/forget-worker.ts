/**
 * `weft.workers.forget` operation + REST binding.
 *
 * Stops listing one worker. A worker that went away stays in `weft.workers.list` with
 * `disconnectedAt` set until an operator forgets it or it registers again; forgetting drops it.
 * A connected worker that finished draining is hidden until it registers again or is resumed. A
 * connected worker still taking work is refused with a `Conflict`: forgetting it would not stop it,
 * and it would reappear at once. Nothing the worker held is touched: the tasks waiting for its
 * queue, and the ones that failed for good, stay where they are.
