/**
 * COR-1472: `signal:waiting` reaches `serve()`'s fleet feed through
 * `appendWorkflowEventIfPresent`, and the per-workflow watch copy written
 * alongside it no longer lands in the engine's event log.
 *
 * Before the fix the watch copies were stored at `ev:<workflowId>:<sequence>`,
 * the hash-chained event log's own keys, so each one replaced the log record at
 * the same sequence. A `signal:waiting` written while a workflow was parked
 * replaced the checkpoint record that carries the replay payload, and a
 * recovery after a crash re-ran the activity that checkpoint had recorded.
