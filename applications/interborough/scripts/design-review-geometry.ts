/**
 * The design review's geometry audit (`.agents/skills/design-review`). A reviewer reading a
 * screenshot cannot tell a two-pixel misalignment from none, or a button whose label has as much
 * room above it as beside it, so a capture also measures each page (`tests/e2e/design-review-geometry-probe.ts`
 * writes the facts beside the screenshots) and this script holds them to the thresholds the rubric
 * states (`references/rubric.md` "Craft"). It writes `geometry-findings.json` and
 * `geometry-report.md` into the capture directory; one defect seen on forty captures is one line
 * naming where.
 *
 *   bun scripts/design-review-geometry.ts --capture <capture directory>
 *
 * `scripts/design-review-capture.ts` runs it after every capture. Exit 0 when the reports were
 * written, 1 when the directory holds no measured capture, 2 on bad usage. A finding is a measured
 * fact, not a verdict: the reviewer confirms it on the screenshot and routes it, because a
 * threshold cannot see intent (a deliberately indented quotation, a primary action meant to span a
 * phone).
